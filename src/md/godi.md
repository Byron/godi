This page explains all sub-commands and how to use them.

When it's your intend to transfer large amounts of data in high-speed and in a sealed (and possibly verified) fashion, `sealed-copy` is the sub-command for you.

Otherwise, you can seal existing folders, and verify them at another time to assure the data is still what it is supposed to be. Please note that filesystems like ZFS have this kind of feature built-in - `godi` just allows you to assert your data's integrity on any storage system.
