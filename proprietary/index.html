<p>There are many programs providing a similar feature-set, as hashing data is not exactly a new invention.
This comparison will therefore focus on the tool that inspired the creation of <code>godi</code> in the first place, <code>mhl</code>.</p>
<p>As the latter doesn't provide the ability to copy data while it hashes it, a program called <em>DoubleData</em> or <em>ShotPutPro</em> could be used for comparison in that regard. However, as there is no free version of these available, there is no comparison just yet.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-mhl">Comparison to MHL</h2>
<p><em>MHL</em>, <a href="http://mediahashlist.org">media-hash-list</a>, is a command-line utility to seal and verify data. It's somewhat specialized to data produced in the media industry.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-over-mhl">Benefits over MHL</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong><ul>
<li><code>godi</code> is up to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Byron/godi/web-resources/lib/gif/mhl_performance-comparison.mov.gif">6x faster</a> in tests on a quad-core laptop CPU, but will scale with more cores and higher available device bandwidth to reach even higher speeds.<ul>
<li>Those inclined may maximize bandwidth by <a href="../details/#Performance%20Considerations">tuning parallelism</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Will read in parallel from multiple devices, leveraging all device's maximum bandwidth. </li>
<li>Can write to multiple devices at once, creating multiple duplicates of your data as fast as your slowest writer. If one device <a href="../details/#Error%20Handling">fails</a>, all other devices will still receive their duplicates, whereas the failed device will <a href="../details/#Atomic%20Operation">not have an intermediate result</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Usability</strong><ul>
<li><code>godi</code> just works. <code>mhl</code> will fail (for some reason) if it finds files it doesn't want to handle, and it ignores symbolic links. <code>godi</code> has no implicit ignore lists, and may be fully customized to suit your needs. By default, it will just ignore volatile files, like <em>.DS_Store</em>.</li>
<li><code>mhl</code> has a gather stage to investigate all files before it does anything. Even though this information is used to show how much more data it has to process, it will take a lot of time on big datasets. <code>godi</code> will start in the moment you hit enter, and inform you about any progress regularly.<ul>
<li>For some reason, <code>mhl</code> presents the total amount of bytes to process according to the amount of bytes it has to hash. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Byron/godi/web-resources/lib/gif/mhl_metrics.mov.gif">This can be confusing</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>godi</code> comes with a state of the art commandline interface, allowing to learn the command by using it. No manual required. <code>mhl</code> has it as well, but it's inconsistent, the front page (<code>mhl [help]</code>) doesn't inform about all available sub-commands and help topics. You will find the missing ones referenced in help-texts of the available topics.</li>
<li><code>mhl</code> seals are not protected against being altered. File corruption or intentional changes can't be detected, and will lead to invalid verification results. </li>
<li><code>mhl</code> doesn't escape characters interpreted by XML, producing invalid MHL files in case a <code>&amp;</code> character is in a file path, without telling you. This can be a real issue, have a look at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Byron/godi/web-resources/lib/gif/mhl_invalid-seal.mov.gif">this demonstration to see it for yourself</a><ul>
<li>I would have left a note, but the <a href="http://mediahashlist.org/discussion/">discussion forum</a> doesn't exist anymore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During verify, <code>mhl</code> will just check one of the sha1 or md5 hashes, in that order, which leaves room as tiny as a billionth atom to accidentally verify a file. <code>godi</code> will verify against all hashes it has taken.</li>
<li><code>godi</code> is available for more platforms and architectures, <code>mhl</code> is 'only' available for windows, linux and osx (all 64bit).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong><ul>
<li><em>Copy or archive on the fly</em><ul>
<li>While hashing, you can also transfer the data, reading it only once in the process. With <code>mhl</code>, you need to copy first, and hash afterwards, which reads the data twice. <code>godi</code>s operation assumes the storage works correctly, however, there is a safe mode which verifies the copy nonetheless.</li>
<li>It will never overwrite existing files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Atomic Operation</em><ul>
<li>It will not produce intermediate results, and either finish successfully, or leave no intermediate files at all</li>
<li>Particularly useful when copying or archiving, as it will not leave any written file(s), allowing to safely abort and retry at will. The latter is good during performance tuning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Open-Source and active Development</strong><ul>
<li>Everyone is free to look at and modify <code>godi</code>s source code. <code>mhl</code> is closed source, downloads are behind a form to retrieve your e-mail address, and the last life-sign was posted <a href="http://mediahashlist.org/news/">July 18th 2013</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefits-of-mhl-over-godi">Benefits of MHL over godi</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Executable Size and Memory Consumption</strong><ul>
<li>The <code>mhl</code> executable is only <em>131kB</em> (OSX) to <em>1.5MB</em> in size, whereas <code>godi</code> clocks in at <em>3.5mB</em>. This is due to differences in how the program is compiled.</li>
<li><code>mhl</code> just uses about 712kB of memory when processing small amounts of files, whereas <code>godi</code> needs about 4mB for the same dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Handling of Meta-Data</strong><ul>
<li><code>mhl</code> will include more information, including a full operation log, in the generated <em>mhl file</em>, whereas <code>godi</code> leaves gathering this information to the user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Special Handling for Image Sequences</strong><ul>
<li>As <code>mhl</code> comes from the media industry, it may read and check frame sequences specifically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Seal File Handling</strong><ul>
<li><code>mhl</code> is able to produce hashes individually and create mhl files from the output of various commands. For example <code>mhl hash -c /path/to/folder/*.mov | mhl file -s -v -o /path/to/folder</code> and <code>openssl dgst -md5 /path/to/files/ -name "*.mov" | mhl file -s -v -o /path/to/folder</code> are possible applications.</li>
</ul>
